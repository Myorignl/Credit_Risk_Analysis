# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview

The urpose of the assignment is to learn how to use Supervised Machine Learning. In this scenario we are presented with a lending company that has tasked us to predict risck in lending to the applicant, we  evaluate indivudual applicants and decide if lending to these individuals is advisable based on the results of the evaluation conducted through machine learning. The kernel mlenv was installed in order to complete the assestment we followed the Supervised Mashine Learning Algorithms. 


  ## Results 
  
 ### *Deliverable 1*
The imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries were used to evaluate data and resampling and oversampling and smote algorithms the data set is resampled to vire the count of ta rget classes, train logistic regression classifier and calculate the balanced accuracy score as wel as generate a confusion matrix abd generate a classification report.  Below are the findings:
